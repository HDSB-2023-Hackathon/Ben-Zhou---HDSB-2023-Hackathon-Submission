Ben's 2023 Hackathon Submission

## UniPlanner 

March 3rd 2023 Project Start!

### Day 1

I've decided to use https://github.com/aridsm/tasks-app as a base for my project.

It has most of the components I need and I will be editing the tasks to suit my needs.

### Day 2

I had a chess tournament and did fairly well!

- Started to remove unessary things and update all the basic stuff (Mismatched text, styles I don't like etc.)
