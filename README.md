March 3rd 2023 Project Start!

## What?



## Progress

### Day 1

I've decided to use https://github.com/aridsm/cards-app as a base for my project.

It has most of the components I need and I will be editing the cards to suit my needs.

### Day 2

I had a chess tournament and did fairly well!

- Started to remove unessary things and update all the basic stuff (Mismatched text, styles I don't like etc.)
- Starting to think about how I'm going to format this
    - Will have list of university applications on the left, each with certain sample questions the university might ask
    - Will be able to add more sample questions and grades to each application

### Day 3

Hopefully today I'll able to finish everything up, I won't be using a database since I don't need to have this ready for prod and everythings gonna be stored in the browser since its fast, also won't be doing user authentication for now.

- Finished up basic layout
- Added a few sample questions, generated by chatgpt lol
